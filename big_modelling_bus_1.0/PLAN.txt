[X] Hello world for models

[ ] RAW vs Structured Artefacts and not simply "models" vs "files"
    Posting types:


    MQTT+FTP:
    - BBB/AAA/artefacts/file/FFF
    - BBB/AAA/artefacts/json/FFF/VVV/{s,u,c}

    - BBB/AAA/observations/file/FFF
    - BBB/AAA/observations/json/FFF/VVV/{s,u,c}

    MQTT:
    - BBB/AAA/observations/basic/FFF/VVV/{s,u,c}

[ ] CDM should have its own ID generator. Separation of concerns!
[ ] Keep alive at MQTT level. Laptop seems to drop the connection.

[ ] Cleaning functionality
    - reportError based on lower level ones. Allow for just the message, and string
    - jsonoperations as modelling_bus module?
    - json.Marshal(m) into jsonoperations + error message??
[ ] Document & clean code
[ ] Enable links between models. Does not need code on the bus side.  
    This is controlled by the poster. Which can simply do this by having an external reference of an element.
    For instance using a local elementID linking to a agentID + modelID + JSONVersion + elementID  combination
    Note that the "modelling_bus/bus-version-1.0/experiment-12.10.2025" part of a model URL is always 
    fixed within one experiment, and that the modelID can be composed of a model-versions-ID and a version-ID

Open modelling bus:
- Read state first ==> auto triggers the statePosts handler?
- Then follow updates and/or considerings

On the editor side, this means we need to have:
- currentState on the XXModel side
- consideredState on the XXModel side

For the WRITER, On the bus side, we need to have two JSON strings:
- previousState
- currentState
but ... as the LISTENER needs the considered state as well, it makes sense to have a copy of that one as well

With operators from XXModels downwards:
- PostTheState: 
  overwrite previousState with the new one
  overwrite currentState with the new one
  push the new state on the bus
- PostTheUpdate:
  overwrite currentState with the new one
  push the delta between the previousState and the currentState to the bus
- PostTheConsidered:
  push the delta between the currentState and the consideredState to the bus

We cannot be listening and writing at the same time.
So, maybe split this into two typing contexts:
- BusWriter
- BusListener

But ... maybe have operators:
- PostTheState
- PostTheUpdate
- PostTheConsidered
- FetchTheState
- FetchTheConsidered
and keep the previous/current/considered in sync between the endpoints, where we indeed have only one posting actor.


Models:
- MQTT (r=1): ~/models/<model id>/<json version>/{s,u,c}/"{ timestamp, link }"
- FTP: ~/models/<model id>/<json version>/{s,u,c}/<timestamp>.json

Files:
- FTP: ~/files/<poster id>/<format>/<timestamp>.extension

Messages:
- MQTT (r=0): ~/messages/<sender id>/<receiver id>/json/<json version>/{" json "}
